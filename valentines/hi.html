                    So etoooo, hi, loveeeeeyy! Hehehehehehe <br>
                    I actually can't believe that we're going to be celebrating Valentine's together, as a couple
                    asdmnsfbmanthajjtmn hindi talaga ako makapaniwala, dahil dati pinapangarap pa lang kita, I used to
                    admire you from afar u know. <br> So naturally, nagulat ako nung nalaman ko na sa'kin ka pala
                    nagkagusto, hindi ko talaga alan kung anong nakita mo sa'kin wahfghgbafhgajagfh it's been four
                    months since we first confessed to each other, but we've already gone on so many dates, it feels
                    like it's been years. And I want to continue spending years with you, and so let this be the first
                    of many love letters I'll be making you.
                    <br><br>
                    I really, really, really love and appreciate you and the love and happiness that you've made me feel
                    within these past four months, lovey. It's so different from everyone else; it's so genuine and
                    sweet. You're the first one to actively let me know that you miss me/need my presence. You're the
                    first one who's ever complimented me on things I never even noticed about myself. You make me want
                    to put in active effort in making you feel loved. That said, I apologize if I haven't always been
                    the ideal lovey in your mind; I know I lack the initiative sometimes. But as long as you let me try,
                    lovey, I will always strive to be the best person for you, because I love you. I want nothing more
                    than to be the person you'll wake up next to, make breakfast with, greet home, and sleep next to. I
                    know it's only been four months, but it's what I feel, loveeeeey. I want to be by your side all the
                    time, yapping about random things or just silently enjoying each other's company. I want to be with
                    you as u travel to all the places in your bucket list and keep all those memories in the pictures
                    you love to take. Someday, I want to look back at our pictures now and remember the entire journey
                    we've been through together. But for now, ito muna 'yung mga dates na napuntahan natin so far
                    (dadamihan natin ng pics sa Ocean Park, okaaaaaaaaayyyy??!!!! '3'), have fun scrolling and
                    reminiscingggg! hehehehehe

                    Naalala ko gumagawa lang ako ng networking ko noon habang nasa mga first stages pa lang tayoooo,
                    talagang nagulat ako sa biglaan mong tanong na <span class="main">"do u like me
                        hasdgasbfansfhasg"</span> <br> <br>
                    That was the start of something very real, something very genuine. Alam ko na noon na never, never,
                    never akong magsisisi na inamin ko na lahat ng nararamdaman ko sa'yo kasi ikaw 'yung pinakaunang tao
                    na nakapagparamdam sa'kin ng ganito. You gave me something to fight for, something to live for,
                    something to enjoy life about. I started looking forward to each f2f day in the anticipation of
                    seeing you again, and having the sight of you grace my eyes once again. <br> <br>
                    <span class="main">The feeling really brings me such peace I never knew was possible, and it still

                    pinalipas na natin 'yung oras. You proved to me that the silence didn't matter as long as I spent

                    From the very first date we had at Basta and YoWell, to the second date. It's like every week, we

                    closer.

                    outside of Espana/Morayta for a date. I still remember the way I slowly reached for your hand while
                    we were on our way, and the way u were loosely holding mine but welcomed it anyway because u were
                    shy. hasgdhasbfmasfbahstgmanb

Sobrang excitingggggg, I finally have someone to welcome the new year with, and that means I can look forward to another year with the one I love, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. <br><br>I know I've said this before, lovey, but all the trouble of finding genuine tickets was worth it when I know you finally got to fulfill one of your dreams, which was to listen to another one of your favorite bands live. Sobrang sulit ng reaction moooo, that one hug you gave me after the concert was proof of it. Alam ko poooo na sobrang laki ng moment na iyon sa iyo, and I can see why because of the chats we had, how u talked about CAS so fondly and passionately. I could tell na gustong-gustong-gusto mo po talagaaaaaa. Naalala ko rin po 'yung reaction mo nung una mong nalaman na magkaka-concert sila here sa MOA, tapos wala pala ikaw monies.

                    Soooooo itooo, nakaabot na pala ikaw ng duloooo, hehehehehe. Sana natuwa po ikaw sa munting site na ginawa ko for uuuu. 'Di ko pa alam kung paano 'yung mga magagarbo talagang effects, kaya sana makapaghintay ikaw until next time :D. <br><br>
                    I just want to thank u again, lovey, for everything. Everything that you've given me, made me feel, made/helped me do. <br><br>
                    Thank you for giving me something to look forward to, to wake up to. Every morning, you're always my first thought. Every day, I wake up thinking "Kumusta na kaya lovey ko? Sana mahimbing parati tulog niya. Sana walang mangyaring masama sa kanya." Every day, my first move is to always reach for my phone and chat u good morning (or gumorninggggg, as u like to call it, HAHHAHHAHHAHAH nahahawa na talaga ako sa typings mo loveeeeeyy). 
                    <br><br>
                    Everything in this little love letter I wrote for u are the memorable moments I've spent with you by my side. No joke, you are the reason I get to go to lots of places now, because I'm not much of a fan of going somewhere alone; I'd rather go with someone special. And I want that special someone to be you. I want it to always be you.
                    <br><br>
                    I first developed a crush on you because you were the one that stood out the most out of your circle. Ikaw po 'yung una kong napansin, loveeeey. From the "yo yo yo yo yo yo yo," to the way you laugh and smile, and the vibe of randomness you radiate, all of that energy somehow levitated to me, and I'm not at all complaining. Ever since I first had a crush on you, my days became brighter. You were someone I admired from afar because I thought you were way out my league. You're so pretty, I imagined lots of people had a crush on u. 
                    <br><br>
                    And to think I thought that was the end of it. The time came when I finally got to know you. All the qualities in a girl I was looking for, you possessed them all. You're God-fearing, God-loving. It's like everything you do, you offer to Him. It honestly reignited my faith in Him. It's difficult to find someone as faithful to Him as you are in this day and age. 
                    <br>
                    You're a mix of the quiet type and the crazy (in a good way) type of girl. I'm not typically attracted to too loud or too noisy girls, but you struck the balance, lovey. With you, it feels like I can never run out of social battery because you're also the one who recharges it. 
                    <br><br>Your smile is like the lone flower in a barren wasteland, lovey. Seeing your smile is like finally coming across an oasis in the desert after wandering hopelessly for so long. Each of my waking days is another day closer to that forever life with you, and I'm in so much anticipation and am so looking forward to future, just because I know you'll be there with me to uncover that which lies in store for us. :)))
                    <br><br>
                    Another thing I love about you is how emotionally attuned you are. How supportive you are. I am amazed at how understanding you are, even in times where you getting mad is absolutely justified. You always try to make an effort to understand the other party's side. I also find it endearing how soft you are, emotionally. You've helped me to tap into my inner emotions more. You brought out the soft, gentle side of me. You may not know it, but you've helped me learn to cry more. I think there's beauty in crying, lovey. Kahit saang sitwasyon, masaya man or malungkot.  'Di po ba, when you cry, it's because of overwhelming emotions? Kaya po I think crying is the pinnacle of being human, because being human means showing emotions. So don't worry, loveeeeey, because every time you cry, I will always be there to wipe your tears. If I'm not, babawi ako. 
                    <br><br>
                    I really hope to be your last love, Cloudyyyyy. I can't imagine anyone else but you to be the one greeting me with a kiss every morning. I want to tell you, "Good luck sa work moo, honeeeeyyy" every time. I want to spend mornings cooking breakfast with you, as we dance in a spacious kitchen filled with all the freshest fruits, veggies, and meat. I want to eat the most delicious breakfasts with you. 
                    <br><br>
                    And if u thought I forgot, yes, I still want to go on those trips with you. Picture us in all of Europe's most beautiful landmarks, like the Colosseum, the Eiffel Tower, the Vatican, and more. Nothing will be more fun than to go on adventures and escapades with the woman I love. 
                    <br><br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    I wish you the Happiest Birthday, my loveeeey! And more to comeeeee! 
                    Good luck with the rest of the midterms! <br>
